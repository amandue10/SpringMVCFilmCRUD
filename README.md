## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D.

### Week 8 Team Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
This weekends project was a team project where we randomly put in pairs to complete a Spring MVC film site. This project was an extension of last week's java application Film Query project where we used mySQL to retrieve information from a database. 

This application implements full web-based C.R.U.D. functionality, using Spring MVC and the DAO pattern. The DAO implementation uses JDBC to persist and retrieve data.

The primary topics applied from week 8 were using Dynamic Web Applications, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), relational databases,  MySQL, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), C.R.U.D(create, read, update and delete), Dependency Injection, Autowiring, Components, MVC (model,view, controller), Inversion of Control, ect.

### Technologies Used
Java Version 1.8, JEE, JSP, Spring MVC, Spring STS, Gradle, Apache Tomcat 8.5, SQL, MySQL, HTML, CSS, XML, Bootstrap Git, Github, Atom

We had several changes to technologies used for this weekends project. We were introduced to Spring Tool Suite and Gradle. 

### Lessons Learned
Amanda owned the Git repository and worked with Yanyan to update our files as we worked on separate tasks. Merge conflicts was a concept that Yanyan and I were unfamiliar with. Working with the TA's was helpful in learning how to deal with merge conflicts and successfully push files to Git.
